We currently use 3 ways to map an entity to an command object:

<ul>
	<li>use the ma.glasnost.orika.MapperFactory.getMapperFacade() and see example in AdministrationController.java</li>
	<li>use the DozerBeanMapper and see example in MediaDetailCommand</li>
	<li>map from scratch in your own code. You don't want to do this really.</li>
</ul>
